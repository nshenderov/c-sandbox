/*
DESCRIPTION
	Takes an integer index and returns the Fibonacci number at that index.
    The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1 and 1, and each subsequent number is
    the sum of the two preceding numbers. The index should be a non-negative
    integer. Passing element_index less 1 may cause undefined behavior.
	This function implemented using recursion. Passing huge element_index
	may cause stack overflow.
RETURN
	The Fibonacci number at the given index.
INPUT
	element_index: the index of the Fibonacci number to calculate.

    This function does not return anything.
